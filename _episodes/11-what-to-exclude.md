## What to not add to Git

A final note on what should and shouldn't be included in Git repositories. 

In general, Git can describe individual line changes for any sort of file that may 
be opened within a text editor. This includes many forms of code, documentation,
HTML, simple data files, etc., but excludes other binary formats like:
- Microsoft Office documents and other rich text documents
- PDF files
- JPEG/PNG images
- Zip files
- Proprietary data files
- Etc..

Git may still store these files, but any version history would be less meaningful, without clear 'diffs'. 
  
More importantly though, Git repositories should not be used to store:
- Personal information, especially usernames, passwords, keys, secrets
- Details that are specific to an individual computer or system (e.g. use relative paths rather than
  full system paths)
- Large volumes of data / input files (make use of services like the [DAP](https://data.csiro.au/) for these)
- Compiled executables, software libraries, and other files that may be regenerated by scripts when needed

Remember to make use of `.gitignore` files to [ignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) and exclude files 
as necessary.
